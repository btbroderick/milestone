### Bayesian Prior
  * Assuming the underlying failure time from the historical control is exponentially distributed with rate parameter $$\lambda e$$
  * The prior distributions for parameters taking values on the entire real line is set to be  normally 
  *	distributed and Gamma prior distributions will be used for positive valued parameters.
  * The parametric distributions used for prediction are the following
