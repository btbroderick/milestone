### Bayesian Prior

-   Assuming the underlying failure time from the historical control is
    exponentially distributed with rate parameter
    *λ**e*
-   The prior distributions for parameters taking values on the entire
    real line is set to be normally
-   distributed and Gamma prior distributions will be used for positive
    valued parameters.
-   The parametric distributions used for prediction are the following

-   Mean for the prior parameters are defaulted with the following

-   The variance for each of the parameters is defaulted to
    10 \* *m**a**x*(|*Θ*|; 1)
     where
    *Θ*
     is the prior mean of the parameter.
